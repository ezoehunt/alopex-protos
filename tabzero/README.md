# Tab Zero Navigation Model

This navigation model is a hub-and-spoke model in which the Homescreen is the hub.

## How to use this prototype

1. Keep [these directions][1] handy on your desktop.
2. Send this URL to your phone: [http://ezoehunt.github.io/alopex-protos/tabzero/lsdkf][2]
3. Open the URL on your phone. 
  * If you have an iPhone, you can add the URL to your homescreen and launch it like an app.
  * If you have an Android or FxOS phone, run the URL inside the browser.
4. Follow the [directions][1] to navigate your way through the prototype. 


## <a name="directions"></a>Directions
* Note: the prototype includes a Status Bar, so you'll see 2 of them stacked on each other.

1. Launch (or open or reload) the prototype.
2. Unlock your phone by swiping the Firefox icon up.
3. Check out your Homescreen. This is your first browser Tab. Scroll up and down - you've already got some things pinned to your Homescreen.
4. Now swipe down from the Status Bar to see your notificiations.
5. Close your notifications by swiping up from the bottom of Notifications (directly above the darker Navigation Bar at the bottom of the screen).
6. Swipe up from the dark Navigation Bar at the bottom of the screen to see the Tab Manager. Since you haven't opened anything else yet, your Homescreen is the only thing in the Tab Manager right now. 
7. Close the Tab Manager by swiping down from the top of the Tab Manager (directly below the darker Status Bar at the top of the screen).
8. You want to check out the latest news at Vox Technology. Scroll down your Homescreen and tap on the Vox Tech icon **to launch a new Tab for Vox Tech.**
9. Tap the 1st article title about Google's self-driving car. Notice that "<" arrow is enabled so you can return to the main Vox Technology page. You can go back and forth between these 2 pages with the arrows.
10. Before moving on, make sure you're on the main Vox Tech page (not the self-driving car one).
10. Now open the Tab Manager. The Vox Tech Tab can be deleted by tapping it (*not working in this prototype*). Note that the Homescreen Tab always stays at the top of your Tab Manager, and it's not close/delete-able. 
11. You're just remembered that you need to reply to a friend's email. Inside the Tab Manager, tap the Home icon in the Navigation Bar.
13. Now tap the Email icon to **launch a new Tab for Email.**
